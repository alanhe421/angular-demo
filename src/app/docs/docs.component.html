    npm link is very similar to npm install -g except that instead of downloading the package from the repo, the just
    cloned angular-cli/ folder becomes the global package. Additionally, this repository publishes several packages and
    we use special logic to load all of them on development setups.

    Any changes to the files in the angular-cli/ folder will immediately affect the global @angular/cli package,
    allowing you to quickly test any changes you make to the cli project.
