  "readme": "# Tsickle - TypeScript to Closure Translator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/angular/tsickle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/angular/tsickle)\n\nTsickle converts TypeScript code into a form acceptable to the [Closure\nCompiler].  This allows using TypeScript to transpile your sources, and then\nusing Closure Compiler to bundle and optimize them, while taking advantage of\ntype information in Closure Compiler.\n\n[Closure Compiler]: https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/\n\n## What conversion means\n\nA (non-exhaustive) list of the sorts of transformations Tsickle applies:\n\n- inserts Closure-compatible JSDoc annotations on functions/classes/etc\n- converts ES6 modules into `goog.module` modules\n- generates externs.js from TypeScript d.ts (and `declare`, see below)\n- declares types for class member variables\n- translates `export * from ...` into a form Closure accepts\n- converts TypeScript enums into a form Closure accepts\n- reprocesses all jsdoc to strip Closure-invalid tags\n\nIn general the goal is that you write valid TypeScript and Tsickle handles\nmaking it valid Closure Compiler code.\n\n## Installation\n\n- Execute `npm i` to install the dependencies.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Project Setup\n\nTsickle works by wrapping `tsc`.  To use it, you must set up your project such\nthat it builds correctly when you run `tsc` from the command line, by\nconfiguring the settings in `tsconfig.json`.\n\nIf you have complicated tsc command lines and flags in a build file (like a\ngulpfile etc.) Tsickle won't know about it.  Another reason it's nice to put\neverything in `tsconfig.json` is so your editor inherits all these settings as\nwell.\n\n### Invocation\n\nRun `tsickle --help` for the full syntax, but basically you provide any tsickle\nspecific options and use it as a TypeScript compiler.\n\n### Differences from TypeScript\n\nClosure and TypeScript are not identical.  Tsickle hides most of the\ndifferences, but users must still be aware of some differences.\n\n#### `declare`\n\nAny declaration in a `.d.ts` file, as well as any declaration tagged with\n`declare ...`, is intepreted by Tsickle as a name that should be preserved\nthrough Closure compilation (i.e. not renamed into something shorter).  Use it\nany time the specific string names of your fields are significant.  That would\nmost often happen when the object either coming from outside your program, or\nbeing passed out of the program.\n\nExample:\n\n    declare interface JSONResult {\n        username: string;\n    }\n    let r = JSON.parse(input) as JSONResult;\n    console.log(r.username);\n\nBy adding `declare` to the interface (or if it were in a `.d.ts` file), Tsickle\nwill inform Closure that it must use exactly the field name `.username` (and not\ne.g. `.a`) in the output JS.  This matters for this example because the input\nJSON probably uses the string `'username'` and not whatever name Closure would\ninvent for it.  (Note: `declare` on an interface has no additional meaning in\npure TypeScript.)\n\n#### Exporting decorators\n\nAn exporting decorator is a decorator that has `@ExportDecoratedItems` in its\nJSDoc.\n\nThe name of the element that have an exporting decorator are preserved through\nthe Closure compilation process.\n\nExample:\n\n    /** @ExportDecoratedItems */\n    function myDecorator() {\n      // ...\n    }\n\n    @myDecorator()\n    class DoNotRenameThisClass { ... }\n\n## Development\n\n### Gulp tasks\n\n- `gulp watch` executes the unit tests in watch mode (use `gulp test.unit` for a\n  single run),\n- `gulp test.e2e` executes the e2e tests,\n- `gulp test.check-format` checks the source code formatting using\n  `clang-format`,\n- `gulp test` runs unit tests, e2e tests and checks the source code formatting.\n\n### Environment variables\n\nExport the environment variable `UPDATE_GOLDENS=1` to have the test suite\nrewrite the golden files when you run it.\n\nExport the environment variable `TEST_FILTER`, a regex, to limit the end-to-end\ntests (found in `test_files/...`) run tests with a name matching the regex.\n",
